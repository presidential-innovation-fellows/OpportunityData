  <h2>Defining Opportunity</h2>
  <p class="usa-font-lead">The Open Opportunity Data development process is grounded in the geography of opportunity â€“ the fact that today, opportunity is not evenly distributed geographically, which we are committed to changing so that where a person starts does not limit where she can end up.</p>
  <p>For the purposes of Open Opportunity Data development, opportunity is defined as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      access to the resources and services that a family, individual, or community needs to thrive, and
    </li>
    <li>
      freedom from the stressors that detract from the family, individual, or community's ability to thrive.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Although the specifics vary by time and local context, the opportunity framework applies widely across diverse end users and objectives.</p>
